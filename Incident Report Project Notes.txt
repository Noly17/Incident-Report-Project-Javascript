This app was developed for Incidents like Accidents, Help, Thypoons.



For this application to work, you need the "frontida application" which is develop by my friend/co-programmer 
and also you need the "Central Application" which is develop by me.


The Frontida App is the one who's sending help or sending data to Central Application then this app will check if the incident 
is troll or it's legit. After the checking the incident, the Central Applicaiton will then mark it spam or forward it to the Last application
which is the Incident Report.
